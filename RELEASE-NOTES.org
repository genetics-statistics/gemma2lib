* ChangeLog v0.01 (2020/xx/xx) TBA

We are excited to announce the first GEMMA2LIB test release with
new functionalities:

** TODO

- [ ] Compute dominance
- [ ] Count missing genotypes at marker

** IN PROGRESS

1. GEMMA1 pass through with 'gemma2 gemma1 opts...'
   + [X] Pass through
2. GEMMA2 PLINK to GEMMA2/Rqtl2 format conversion
   + [X] Complete
3. GEMMA2 BIMBAM to GEMMA2/Rqtl2 conversion
   + [X] Convert GeneNetwork style BIMBAM (0,0.5,1)
         see https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2data/tree/master/BXD
   + [ ] Convert example mouse BIMBAM with 0.45 values, i.e., use real
     numbers
4. GEMMA2 GEMMA2/Rqtl2 to BIMBAM conversion
   + [X] Convert to BIMBAM as an intermediate solution
   + [X] Handle encoding of major/minor allele on the fly
5. Filtering
   + [X] Phenotypes (NA)
   + [X] other filters
6. Handle dominance
   + [ ] see https://github.com/genetics-statistics/GEMMA/issues/34
